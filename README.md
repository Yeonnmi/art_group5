# Cellular Automata Art
### MEMBERS:
Jaime Luis Manalo, Kielo Bash Mercado, Hurley Valen Salig

### DESCRIPTION:
The task is to "reuse existing NetLogo CA models and produce rules that generate beautiful CA art."
All models we used are provided by the libraries of Netlogo.
### The Brain (Game of Life Art)

A pattern resembling the human brain. Based on the game of life model in netlogo, where in cells have 3 rules based on neighboring cells. These rules are birth, where a new cell is created, death,  where a cell is killed, and survival, where a cell is retained.
### Pyramid (Elementary Cellular Automata Art)
![pyramid](https://github.com/Yeonnmi/art_group5/blob/main/pyramid%20elementary%20ca%20.png?raw=true)

The artwork displays a pyramid shape. The model is exhibiting elementary cellular automata where in cells are updated by following a set of rules which are represented by an 8-bit binary number. This pyramid artwork specifically follows rule 57 (00111001) using a single yellow cell to create a pyramid shape. This rule can also generate images that give an illusion of 3d patterns such as steps and layered pyramids.
### Zebra (Fur Model)

The artwork shows a Zebra like pattern. The Fur model is a model first proposed by Alan Turing, this simulates the different styles of pigmentation of animals which may explain the diverse patterns found on animals' skin, such as stripes, spots, and blobs. The parameters used to create this pattern are: 
- inner-radius-x = 3
- inner-radius-y = 5
- outer-radius-x = 6
- outer-radius-y = 8
- density = 40%
- ratio = 0.41
