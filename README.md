### DESCRIPTION:
The task is to reuse existing NetLogo CA models and produce rules that generate beautiful CA art.
All models provided by the libraries of Netlogo.
### Game of Life Art
Based on the game of life model in netlogo, where in cells have 3 rules based on neighboring cells. These rules are birth, where a new cell is created, death,  where a cell is killed, and survival, where a cell is retained.
### Elementary Cellular Automata Art
The model is exhibiting elementary cellular automata where in cells are updated by following a set of rules which are represented by an 8-bit binary number. This pyramid artwork specifically follows rule 57 (00111001).
### Fur Model
The Fur model is a model first proposed by Alan Turing, this simulates the different styles of pigmentation of animals which may explain the diverse patterns found on animals' skin, such as stripes, spots, and blobs. The image shows a Zebra like pattern. The parameters used to create this pattern are: 
- inner-radius-x = 3
- inner-radius-y = 5
- outer-radius-x = 6
- outer-radius-y = 8
- density = 40%
- ratio = 0.41
